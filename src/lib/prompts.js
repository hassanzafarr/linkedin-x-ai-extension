## Instructions
Generate exactly 3 reply options. Each reply must:
- Match my writing voice from the examples above
- Be appropriate for ${platformCtx}
- Add genuine value: an insight, a question, or a specific affirmation — never generic filler
- NOT start with "Great post!", "Absolutely!", "I totally agree", or similar hollow openers
- Be ready to post with no editing needed

Return ONLY a valid JSON array with exactly 3 strings. No markdown, no explanation.
Example: ["reply one", "reply two", "reply three"]`;

## Profile page text
${(profileText || '').slice(0, 14000)}

## Activity page text
${(activityText || '').slice(0, 22000)}

## Task
Produce four things:

1. **name** — user's full name (or empty string if not visible).
2. **headline** — current professional headline (or empty string).
3. **story** — a 3-5 sentence first-person summary of what the user works on, builds, and cares about. Based ONLY on the scraped text. Write as the user ("I am…", "I work on…"). Include their role, domain, current focus, and any unique experiences or themes evident from posts. Minimum 30 characters.
4. **writingStyle** — a 3-6 sentence description of HOW the user writes (tone, sentence length, formality, use of lists/emojis/hashtags, recurring rhetorical moves, vocabulary patterns). Written in third-person about the user's style ("They tend to…", "Posts often…"). Minimum 15 characters. Based on the actual samples — do not invent.
5. **samples** — 5-10 of the user's own posts/comments that best represent their voice. Strip UI artifacts ("see more", "Like", "Comment", reaction counts, "Activity", "Posts", other users' names, ads, sponsored snippets). Keep only complete first-person writing, each 1-12 sentences.

Return ONLY valid JSON, no markdown, no commentary:
{
  "name": "...",
  "headline": "...",
  "story": "...",
  "writingStyle": "...",
  "samples": ["...", "..."]
}`;
}

- 50–79: Moderate — relevant but not exceptional
- 0–49: Low — generic, spammy, or off-topic

Return ONLY valid JSON: { "score": <0-100>, "reasons": ["reason1", "reason2"] }`;
